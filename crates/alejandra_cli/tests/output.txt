  The Uncompromising Nix Code Formatter
  
  Usage: alejandra [OPTIONS] [INCLUDE]...
  
  Arguments:
    [INCLUDE]...  Files or directories, or a single "-" (or leave empty) to format
                  stdin
  
  Options:
    -e, --exclude <EXCLUDE>
            Files or directories to exclude from formatting
    -c, --check
            Check if the input is already formatted and disable writing in-place
            the modified content
        --experimental-config <EXPERIMENTAL_CONFIG>
            [Experimental] Path to a config file. If not provided, it'll default
            to `alejandra.toml` in the current directory. If not found, it'll use
            the default style
    -t, --threads <THREADS>
            Number of formatting threads to spawn. Defaults to the number of
            physical CPUs [env: ALEJANDRA_THREADS=1]
    -q, --quiet...
            Use once to hide informational messages, twice to hide error messages
    -h, --help
            Print help
    -V, --version
            Print version
  
  Alejandra will exit with status code:
    1, if any error occurs.
    2, if --check was used and any file requires formatting.
    0, otherwise.
